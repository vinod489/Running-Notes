AuthenticationProvider - Authentication provider provides a two methods authenticate and support
Provider Manager - getProviders()

	request --> Spring filters -> Provider Manager gives the list of Authentication Provider -> Provider will check the authentication and allow the request
	
URL	ReWriting - 	Adding logged in URL params in the URL with ?
Sticky sessions - always pass the requests to same node from Load balancer - to avoid session problem - problem is when the node crashed

There is a problem with session management in case of having different nodes
since each node has separate session store -- so user has to login separately for each node 
This can be avoided by mainatining a common store like a inmemory cache like Redis Cache or Memcached - And backup also has to be maintained for this 

Json Web Tokens

 - Used for authorzation not for authentication
 - Two machines can talk in a secured way
 
 Industry standard specification - JWT RFC 7519
 
 Structure of JWT
 --JWT will be in encoded format
--Three parts
Encoded Header -- Alogorithm and type of token -- Algorithm 
Encoded Payload
Encoded Verify Signature

JSON WEB signature - Signature Algorithms
JSON WEb ENcryption - ENcryption algorithms
JSON WEB Algorihtms
JSON Object signing and ENcryption

Claim names and Claim Values

Keys in payload object are called claims
Values in payload object are called claim values

There will be a registered claim names also like "sub", "iat", "aud", "jti". We can also register a public claim name
private claim names 

Token expiry will be decided based in token issued date and token expiry date

SAML Authentication

Federation Of Identity
 - Use Single Sign on solutions like SAML,Open ID Connect , AUTH
 For doing single sign on - We have to come into aggregement
 
 IDP - identity Provider server - which do the user identification by looking into user active directory
 SP - Service provider
 
 Meta data exchange - On successful login, ADP gives token in response and use this token for exchanging between service providers
 
 IDP initiated 
 
 SAML - Open standard provides single sign on for web applications - both for authentication & authorization
 OAUTH - Its for authorization only
 
 SAML has three entities - 
 1. Web Browser (user agent)
 2. Indentity Provider
 3. Service Provider
 
 While configuring SAML Federation we establish a trust relationship between SP and IDP
 
 On singing on into IDP -- IPD generates SAML assertion
