Distributed Transactions

2 phase commit
	- Prepare Phase && Commit Phase
		- Coordinator 
			- creates a transaction id
			- calls the Customer waller service and block the credit
			- Calls the order service and prepare the order
			- Both services return the response to coordinator
			- Until both services are returned back, the wallet and the order are blocked
			- Coordinator also waits for the response
			- Once both services returned success - issues commit transaction to customer wallet and order service
			- Responded back to coordinator
			- In case customer wallet fails due to insufficient balance - retruns failed response to coordinator
