Pod -> A single unit of deployment
To deplooy a application in kubernetees cluster we minimum need one pod
Where pods are located
	-> we generally deploy pods on worker node
	-> every pod running on node contians IP address
	-> one main container + helper containers
	-> One POD communicate with another POD using its IP
	-> All the containers running on a POD ust have unique IP
	-> Contianers with in the same POD can communicate with same IP
	-> To deploy a POD we can create by describing a commands in yml file
		-> apiVersion - Which version of kubernetes API you are using
		-> kind - Whta kind og object you want to create (Pod/service..)
		-> metdata - Data helps uniquely identifying the object
