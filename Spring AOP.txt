Spring AOP

Aspect Oriented Programming

-> Suppose we want to add logging to DAO methods -> We have to do change to all the methods of DAO

-> Suppose we want to add security to DAO methods -> We have to do change to all the methods of DAO
	-> If we need to add all methods of service layer -> We have to do change to all the methods of Service
	-> If we have to add to entire system -> we have to do lot of changes

-> Other possible solutions
	-> Inheritance -> every class should implement this inheritance
	-> Delegation -> Delegating to respective managers -> Still every method has to be changed
	
Aspect can be used at multiple locations
Sample aspect/class ... applied based on configuration

-> applies the proxy design pattern
-> Much better than being scattered everywhere
-> Promotes code reuse and easier to change
-> Business code in application is cleaner
-> Reduces code complexity
-> Configurable - Based on configuration, apply Aspects selectively to different parts of app
				-> No need to make changes to any part of code

Most Common
	-> Logging,Security, transactions
Audit Logging
	-> Who, what, when, where
Exception Handling
	-> log exception and notify devops via SMS/email
API Management
	-> How many times has a method been called
	-> analytics: What are peak times? What is average load? Who is top user?
Advantages
	-> Resuable Modules
	-> Resolve code tangling
	-> Resolve code scatter
	-> Applied selectively based on configuration
Disadvantages
	-> Too many aspects and app flow is hard to follow
	-> Mnior performance cost for aspect execution
	
Aspect -> module of code for cross cutting concern(logging, security....)
Advice -> What action is taken and when it should be applied
Joint Point -> When to apply code during program execution
Pointcut -> A Predicate Expression for where advice should be applied

Advice types
 -> Before Advice - run before the method
 -> After finally advice - run after the method (finally)
 -> After returning advice - run after the method (success execution)
 -> After throwing advice - run after method(if execption is thrown)
 -> Around Advice - run before and after method
 
Weaving 
	Connecting aspects to target objects to create an advised object
	Different types of weaving
		-> compile time and runtime
Two Leading Frameworks

Spring AOP and AspectJ

Spring provides AOP Support
Key Components of Spring
	Security, Caching,Transactions
	Use runtime weaving of aspects
	Uses Proxy pattern
Advantages
	-> Simpler to use than AspectJ
	-> Use Proxy Pattern
	-> Can Migrate to AspectJ when @Aspect is used
Disadvantages
	-> Only supports method-level joint points
	-> Can only aspects to beans created by Spring app context
	-> Minor performance cost because of runtime weaving



AspectJ
	-> Provides complete support of AOP
	-> join supports: method level, constructor and field
	-> code weaving: compile time,post compile-time and loading

Advantages
	-> Support all joint points
	-> Support any POJO not only beans created by spring
	-> Faster performance
	-> Complete AOP support
Disadvantages
	-> Compile-time Weaving requires extra compilation setup
	-> AspectJ pointcut syntax can become complex
	
@Before Advice
Main App ----> AOP Proxy -----> Target Object
Runs before calling the target object

Even though we using Spring AOP ..still need AspectJ Jar file
Spring AOP uses some of the AspectJ annotations and AspectJ classes

To enable AspectJ --> Add @EnableAspectJAutoProxy to spring onfiguration class

1.
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
@ComponentScan("<base package>")
public class SpringConfig {
}

2.
Main App
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(DemoConfig.class);
AccountDAO dao = context.getBean("accountDAO", AccountDAO.class);
dao.addAccount();
context.close();

3. Create Aspect Module
@AspectJ
@Component
public class myDemoAspect {
	@Before("execution(public void addAccount())") --> pointcut expression --> tells spring this code has to run before running addAccout
	public void beforeAddAccount() {
		
	}
}


Pointcut expression language
	->execution(modifiers-pattern? return-type-pattern declaring-type-pattern? method-name-pattern(param-pattern) thorws-pattern?)
	
	modifiers-pattern - Spring only supports public or *
	modifiers-pattern,declaring-type-pattern and thorws-pattern are optional
	pattern is optional if it as ?
	for patterns we can use * to match on everything
	
	Ex:- @Before("execution(public void com.package.addDAOaccout(parameter))")
	match on every class -> @Before("execution(public void addDAOaccout(parameter))")
	Any match starting with add @Before("execution(public void add*(parameter))")
	Any match starting with processCreditCard and return verificationResult 
		--> @Before("execution(public verificationResult processCreditCard*(parameter))")
	Any method starts with processCreditCard with any public accessor and any return type --> @Before("* * processCreditCard*())")
	modifier is optional --> @Before("* processCreditCard*())")
	
Parameters pattern
	() -> matches a method without parameters
	(*) -> matches a method with one argument of any type
	(..) -> matches a method with 0 or more arguments of any type
	
	Match with any method of any class of a package
	@Before("execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.demo.*.*(..))") -> Matches with any class of any method with 0 or more aguments in com.luv2code.aopdemo.demo package

Pointcut declarations
	-> How to reuse a pointcut expression for diffent aspect methods
	-> 1. Create a pointcut declaration
		@Pointcut("execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.dao.*.*(..))")
		private void forDaoPackage() {} --> Name of pointcut expression
	-> Apply pintcut declaration name to other methods
		@Before("forDaoPackage()") -->//use pointcut declaration time
		public void method1() {}
		
		@Before("forDaoPackage()")
		public void method2() {}
		
Combining pointcuts
	->How to aply multiple pointcut expressions to a single advice
	->Execute an advice if only certain conditions are method
	->Example
		->All methods in a package except getter/setter
	->can combine  pointcut expressions using logic operators
		AND(&&)
		OR(||)
		NOT(!)
	->Ex- 	@Before("expressionOne() && expressionTwo()")
			@Before("expressionOne() || expressionTwo()")
			@Before("expressionOne() && !expressionTwo()")
	->Ex:- except getter and setter
	@Pointcut("execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.aop.*.*(..))")
	private void forDaoPackage(){}
	
	@Pointcut("execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.aop.*.get*(..))")
	private void getter(){}
	
	@Pointcut("execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.aop.*.set*(..))")
	private void setter(){}
	
	@Pointcut("forDaoPackage() && !(setter() && getter())")
	private void method1(){}

Ordering Aspects
	->How to control the order of advices being applied
		->If more than one advice satisfied for method -> spring will take random order
			->place advices in separate aspects
			->Add @Order to aspects
			-> Lower numbers have high precendence
		->
			@Aspect
			@Component
			@Order(1)
			public class MyFirstAspect() {
			}
			
			@Aspect
			@Component
			@Order(2)
			public class MySecondAspect() {
			}
			
			@Aspect
			@Component
			@Order(3)
			public class MySecondAspect() {
			}
			
			Range: Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE
			Negative numbers are allowed

JoinPoints
	-> How to get method params and signature in aspect method
	
	Ex:- @Before("..")
	public void beforeAddAccountAdivce(JoinPoint theJointPoint) {
		MethodSignature methodSig = (MethodSignature)theJointPoint.getSignature(); --> to get method signature
		Object[] args = theJointPoint.getArgs();
		
	}

@AfterReturning - run after successful execution of method
@AfterReturning(
	pointcut="execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.demo.accountDAO.findAccounts(..))",
	returning="result") --> returning parameter "result" holds the return value of method
public void afterReturningFindAccountService(JointPoint theJointPoint, List<Account> result) {
}

Post process the data before returning to caller
format the data before returning the caller

@AfterReturning(
	pointcut="execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.demo.accountDAO.findAccounts(..))",
	returning="result") --> returning parameter "result" holds the return value of method
public void afterReturningFindAccountService(JointPoint theJointPoint, List<Account> result) {
	if(!result.isEmpty()) {
		result.add("modified");--> Modifying the result before returning to caller
	}
}

@AfterThrowing
- After any exception is thrown

		findAccounts()				findAccounts()				exception
Main App -------------> AOP Proxy -----------------> AccountDAO ----------> @AfterThrowing advice
		<-------------            <-------------------------------------------
			exception						exception
			
Uses
	-> Logging exception
	-> Perform auditing on exception
	-> send mail to devops
	-> encapsulate the functionality in aspect and reuse
	
@AfterThrowing	(
	pointcut="execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.dao.AccountDAO.findAccounts(..))",
	throwing="throwExec"
	)
public void afterThrowingAdvice(JointPoint jointpoint, Throwable throwExec) {
	
}

	-> we are just intercepting the exception
	-> Still the exception will propogate to main App
	
@After Advice Type
	- It will run after completion of method regradless of success or failure


- if advice methods defined in the same @Aspect class that need to run at the same join point
- the @After advice method is invoked AFTER any @AfterReturning or @AfterThrowing advice methods in the same aspect class
So in our case, the @After and @AfterThrowing are in the same aspect class


@Around advice
	-> runs before and after completion of method
	-> its like combination of Before and After
	-> uses
		-> Logging, auditing, security
		-> Pre-processing and post-processing data
		-> Instrumentation/profiling code
		-> Managing exceptions -> Swallow/handle/stop exceptions
	-> get reference to proceeding joint point
	-> This is to handle target method
	-> your code can use the proceeding joint point to execute  target method
	
	@Around("execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.service.*.getFortune(..))")
	public Object afterGetfortune(ProceedingJointPoint proceddingJointPoint) throws Throwable {
		long begin = System.currentTimeMilis();
		Object result = proceddingJointPoint.proceed();
		long end = System.currentTimeMilis();
		long duration =  end-start;
		return result; --> returning result to calling function
	}
	
	Handle Exceptions
		-> can handle/rethrow exception
		
	@Around("execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.service.*.getFortune(..))")
	public Object afterGetfortune(ProceedingJointPoint proceddingJointPoint) throws Throwable {
		long begin = System.currentTimeMilis();
		try {
			Object result = proceddingJointPoint.proceed();
		} catch(Exception e) {
			//handle exception
			return "Exception";
		}
		long end = System.currentTimeMilis();
		long duration =  end-start;
		return result; --> returning result to calling program
	}
	
	Rethrowing Exceptions
	
	@Around("execution(* com.luv2code.aopdemo.service.*.getFortune(..))")
	public Object afterGetfortune(ProceedingJointPoint proceddingJointPoint) throws Throwable {
		long begin = System.currentTimeMilis();
		try {
			Object result = proceddingJointPoint.proceed();
		} catch(Exception e) {
			//handle exception
			throw e;
		}
		long end = System.currentTimeMilis();
		long duration =  end-start;
		return result; --> returning result to calling program
	}
	
Real time example with AOP
	->Enable AspectJ Auto Proxy(XML)
		<aop:aspectj-autoproxy> -> spring supports the @Aspect class
	-> Java configuration -> @EnableAspectJAutoProxy
